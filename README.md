# Horse Stock Management System

## Introduction
This Horse Stock Management System is a desktop application designed to manage the inventory of horses for stables, farms, and equestrian clubs. It showcases the integration of a user-friendly interface with a robust backend database system to streamline the process of tracking horse-related data.

## Key Features
- **Data Entry**: Add new horse records with details such as ID, name, price, and availability.
- **Data Modification**: Update existing horse records to reflect changes in price, stock levels, etc.
- **Data Deletion**: Remove records of horses that are no longer available or in stock.
- **Reporting**: Generate comprehensive reports on the current stock of horses, including all relevant details.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The core programming language used for developing the application.
- **PyQt5**: A set of Python bindings for The Qt Company's Qt application framework, used for crafting the graphical user interface.
- **MySQL**: The backend database that stores all horse records and inventory data.
- **SQLAlchemy (Optional)**: An SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library for Python that can be used for database interactions.

## Executable Application
For ease of access, the application is bundled as an executable file that can be run on any compatible system without the need to set up a Python environment.
